        <P>
        The olives sit in a liquid with garlic and herbs; when draining, 
        please try to reserve as much of the herbs and garlic as possible. <BR>
        Alternatively, you can add in your own garlic and freeze-dried basil.
        If you do not have an iron skillet, you can use a stoneware baking dish.<BR>
        It is important to remove bread from the pan as soon as it comes out of the oven, because bread left in the pan will get moist and soggy.
